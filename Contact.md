# Web Development Contract.

> A contract between me: Gabriel Dunn ("I", "me", "developer", "Gabe Dunn", or "Gabe Dunn Development" in this document) and you: Placeholder Inc. ("you", "client", "Placeholder", "Placeholder Inc.", or "John Smith" in this document).

## Introduction


I will always do my best to fulfil your needs and meet your goals, but sometimes it is best to have a few simple things written down so that we both know what is what, who should do what and what happens if things go wrong. In this contract you won't find complicated legal terms or large passages of unreadable text. I have no desire to trick you into signing something that you might later regret. I want what's best for the safety of both parties, now and in the future.

## Project Summary


You, the client (Placeholder Inc.), are hiring me, Gabriel Dunn, to develop a web application for the estimated total price of outlined in our previous correspondence. The agreed payment plan is at the end of the document.

## Agreements of Both Parties


As my client, you agree:


 - That you have the power to enter into this contract on behalf of yourself, your company, or your organization.
 - To provide me with everything that I need to complete the project including (but not limited to) text, copy, account credentials, images, and other information as and when I need it, in the format that I ask for.
 - To review my work, provide feedback, and sign-off within agreed upon timescales.
 - To be bound by any dates that we set together for deadlines.
 - To stick to the payment schedule described at the end of this contract.


As the developer, I agree:


 - That I have the experience and ability to perform the services that we have agreed upon.
 - To carry out this service in a professional and timely manner.
 - To respect the confidentiality of any information that you give me.
 - To endeavor to meet all of the deadlines set, but I can't be held responsible for a missed launch date or deadline if you have been late in supplying materials or have not approved or signed off on my work on time at anystage.

## Details of the Work


I can and will provide suggestions for designs, templates, look and feel, layout, and functionality of the web application. I will provide some design support as necessary to complete the design of the app, fully develop the application, and implement a custom backend as needed, and potentially extend the backend to allow for future maintenance of the site on your own.

*Testing and Cross-Browser Compatibility*

I will not be testing the application in old or abandoned environments, including but not limited to some examples such as Microsoft Internet Explorer, previous versions of browsers such as Apple's Safari, Mozilla's Firefox, Google's Chrome (or Chromium), or Opera unless otherwise specified. If you need to show the same orsimilar visual design to users using these older browsers, we will have to re-negotiate an increased rate, as developing for these older browser is costly and time-consuming.

*Content Input*

I am not responsible for writing or inputting any content. That includes but is not limited to: products, pagecontent, categories, attributes, and product tags. I'll be happy to help, though, and in addition to the initialestimate I will charge you at an hourly rate for this content input. Even so, I expect most of the copy to be provided by you, as you know the nature of your business and message better than I do.

*Workflow and Design*

If you have already engaged the services of a graphic designer who has produced mockups of the design of yourwebsite, I will work from these and endeavor to produce a website resembling them as closely as possible. Note that it might not be possible to produce pixel-perfect interpretations of them across all browsers and under all circumstances due to technical limitations beyond my control. I will need your mockups in both PSD PNG, and whichever other source files you were provided with all of the original layers intact so I can access the requiredassets from them directly.

*Changes and Revisions*

Changes and revisions can be submitted by the client upon review of each milestone or phase (referred to solely as "phase"), and finally upon review of the last phase which will include a project-wide review. If further work is needed after the completion of the final phase, work can be acquired at an additional cost of $70CAD/hour, subject to change based upon availability.

As each phase is being worked on, changes and revisions should be communicated quickly and directly so that fixeshappening on an ongoing basis. When development has been completed for a phase, feedback from the client cannot take more than 3 business days or the phase is considered to be satisfactorily complete.

## Cancelling this Contract


If you wish to cancel this Agreement:


 - I will retain your down payment.
 - I will retain the payments for each of the completed phases.
 - If I am working on a phase that has not yet been completed, that phase will be considered completed and as such I will receive full payment for it as a "kill fee".
 - The "kill fee" will be considered the final payment for the project.


If I wish to cancel this Agreement:

## Legal Stuff


I will take the utmost care and attention to ensure that my provided product is error-free and adequately future-proofed, but due to the rapidly-evolving nature of the web ecosystem and standards it is not possible to guarantee that the code will function as intended indefinitely and as such I can't be liable to you or any third party for damages, including but not limited to lost profits, lost savings or any other incidental, consequential , or special damages arising out of the operation of, inability to operate, or loss of function of this web application and any other web application, even if I have been made aware of the possibilities of such damages.

*Severability.* Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect and the invalid or unenforceable provision shall be replaced by a valid or enforceable provision.

*Third Party Materials.* All third party materials are the exclusive property of their respective owners. I shall inform you of all third party materials that may be/are required to perform the services or otherwise integrated into the final project. Under such circumstances, I shall inform you of any need to license.

*Exclusivity.* Placeholder Inc. expressly acknowledge that although they are free to engage others to perform services of the same or similar nature to those provided by Gabriel Dunn, I must be notified of such engagements, and in the occurrence of an engagement of this nature I retain the right to terminate my involvement in the project and consider it equivalent to - under the terms of this contract - you cancelling the agreement, and as such I will retain the right to receive the same "kill fee" referred to in the previous cancellation section. Additionally, Gabriel Dunn shall be entitled to offer and provide my services to others, solicit other clients, and otherwise advertise the services offered by Gabriel Dunn.

## Copyrights and Intellectual Properties


You guarantee to me that any elements of text, graphics, photos, designs, trademarks, or other artwork that you provide me for inclusion in the web application are either owned by your good self, or that you have permission to use them.

When I receive the final payment, all copyright and intellectual property is automatically assigned as follows:


 - You own the graphics and other visual elements that I create for you for this project. I will give you a copy of all related files and you should store them carefully as I will not be required to keep them nor provide any native source files that I used in making them. If I decide to provide any of these native source files, I will be under no future requirement to provide or replace these files at any time.
 - You also own all text content, photographs, and other data that you provided, unless they are owned by someone else.
 - I reserve the right to retain a copy of all files used in or relating to the creation of the project. This does not mean that I own the copyright to them.
